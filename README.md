# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Unit Project #3: Page Speed Dashboard

For my final project I choose Google's Page Speed Insights API to allow me to check the speed score of a given website from both a mobile and desktop perspective.
I can then add the recomendations given to a to-do list so I can take action on it.



## Necessary Deliverables

* A **production ready web application**, SPA, hosted live on the web.
* A **new git repository hosted on Github** where codebase is maintained.
* A 3-5 minute **presentation** including at least 3 technical hurdles, 2 new
  things you learned, and what you'd like to do next with your app.

### Due Date

Presentations will be held Wednesday July 27th in class.

Your project must be submitted before class starts on Wednesday 27th July (class
starts at 6pm).

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

Students will fork the "ga-js1-spa" application and commit their code as they
complete pieces of functionality.

The instructional team will grade each technical requirement and provide a
numeric grade on a scale.

- **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the
  technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build
  something that was reasonably complex?
- **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your
  project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not
  just a hello world response)?
- **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices
  covered in class, such modularity and semantic naming? Did you comment your
  code as your instructors have in class?
- **Total**: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project.

Each category is scored according to the below, where a `1` is a _pass_.

Score | Expectations
----- | ------------
**0** | _Does not meet expectations._
**1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
**2** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

The total will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project
goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which
can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
